# Activity 1: Specify the Liver Cirrhosis Prediction Results

## Problem Overview
Liver cirrhosis is a chronic liver disease that causes irreversible damage to the liver tissue. Early diagnosis can significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts the risk of liver cirrhosis in a patient using clinical data. 

## Expected Outcome
- Input: Patient’s clinical test data (Bilirubin, SGPT, SGOT, Albumin, Age, Gender, etc.)
- Output: Prediction – Risk of Liver Cirrhosis (Yes/No)
- Model: Random Forest, KNN, XGBoost (best model saved as `.pkl`)
- Interface: Flask-based web UI where users enter test data and get predictions in real-time.

## Impact
- Early intervention by healthcare professionals
- Non-invasive, fast, and accurate risk screening
- Reduction in advanced-stage complications
